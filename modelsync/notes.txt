I should add remove_raw and update_raw functions to mongodb.coffee and update and remove should be implemented by a standard concrete-collection-mixin

I want to instantiate each object before changing it.. (I want this to be an extra option, not a common thing!)

and work on the remoteobject level events like 'remove' and 'remoteupdate'

build a sample website

work on collection query level subscriptions

collectionexposer subscriptions?
