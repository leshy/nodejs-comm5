I should add remove_raw and update_raw functions to mongodb.coffee
and update and remove should be implemented by a standard concrete-collection-mixin

I want to instantiate each object before changing it..

Also, investigate an option of using standard messaging of the RemoteCollection for subscriptions (this would mean that I want to inherit msgnode in the standard collection/subscription mixin too, which is fine..)

and work on the remoteobject level events like 'remove' and 'remoteupdate'

build a sample website

work on collection query level subscriptions
